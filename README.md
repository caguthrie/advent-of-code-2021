# Advent of code 2021 solutions

This is a WIP for my solutions for [Advent Of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/).

The code is written with nodejs v16 and to test the solution, must be installed.

In the [days](./days) directory, there is a directory for each day I have solutions for. For each day, there are two stars to achieve, and each star is labeled as the filename. The appropriate data for that day is also located in that directory.

To set up the project, run `npm i` in the project root.

To run the solution, `cd` in to the appropriate directory and run a star file with `ts-node`, e.g. `ts-node star1.js`
